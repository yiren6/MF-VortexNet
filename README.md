# Abstract

Aircraft design relies on accurate aerodynamic predictions. High-fidelity (HF) methods, such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD), provide accurate predictions of aerodynamic loads but are computationally expensive for early-stage design. Conversely, low-fidelity (LF) methods, such as the vortex lattice method (VLM), offer rapid solutions with low computational cost but struggle to capture complex flow phenomena, limiting their predictive accuracy. The conceptual design process thus presents a fidelity-cost trade-off, requiring a balance between HF and LF data in early design phases. This study proposes a multi-fidelity conceptual design analysis workflow that integrates a graph neural network (GNN)-based physics-informed, lightweight trainable surrogate model, **VortexNet**, into the VLM to augment the analysis fidelity of LF tools. The surrogate model learns corrections to LF panel-wise pressure field data using data-driven insights from HF CFD simulations, thus allowing accurate and efficient aerodynamic analyses on arbitrary quantities of interest.

When the proposed workflow is used for performance assessment for various Delta wing geometries under low speed and high angle of attack (AOA), the surrogate model VortexNet demonstrates strong prediction accuracy and generalizability across geometries and free-stream conditions, and effectively captures the nonlinear flow features under geometric variations. Compared with using VLM alone, the multi-fidelity analysis workflow achieves a **threefold reduction in the normalized root mean square error (NRMSE)** for the predicted aerodynamic coefficients. A prediction mechanism explanation, leveraging the **latent space ablation** technique, is conducted to rationalize the model‚Äôs predictive capabilities and provide guidance for future improvements in VortexNet-like surrogate modeling. These results indicate that the proposed multi-fidelity workflow, leveraging the surrogate model VortexNet, has the potential as a valuable tool for design fidelity improvement in conceptual design.



# High-level Overview

## üöÄ Goal

Improve the accuracy and efficiency of aerodynamic predictions in **conceptual aircraft design** by integrating:
- **Low-fidelity (LF)** models like the Vortex Lattice Method (VLM)
- **High-fidelity (HF)** models like CFD (RANS)
- A **graph neural network (GNN)**-based surrogate model called **VortexNet**
into a conceptual aircraft design environment [SUAVE](https://github.com/suavecode/SUAVE).
---

## üß† Why It Matters

- **CFD** is accurate but too **computationally expensive** for early-stage design.
- **VLM** is fast but **fails to capture nonlinear phenomena** (e.g., vortex lift, flow separation).
- Conceptual design needs a **trade-off between speed and fidelity**.
- The proposed method brings **CFD-level accuracy** at **VLM-level cost** inside a design-evaluation cycle.

## üõ†Ô∏è Methods

- Designed a **GNN-based surrogate model** (VortexNet) that learns pressure field corrections from CFD data.
  ![Work flow](images/workflow.png)
- Implemented a **multi-fidelity workflow** that augments VLM with GNN-predicted corrections.
- Used:
  - **Graph Attention Networks (GATv2)** with **U-Net-style architecture**
  - **k-fold cross-validation** training
  - **Physics-informed loss functions**
    The loss function combines SmoothL1Loss, SignLoss, and PhysicalLoss to train VortexNet. SmoothL1 minimizes error magnitude, SignLoss penalizes sign mismatches, and PhysicalLoss adds physics-informed constraints. The PhysicalLoss balances physics-driven accuracy and training efficiency, with all contributions controlled by tunable hyperparameters.

    $\mathcal{L} = \text{SmoothL1Loss} \left( q^{HF}, q^{\text{pred}} \right) + \Lambda \text{PhysicalLoss} \left( q^{\text{pred}}  \right) + \Omega \text{SignLoss} \left(q^{HF}, q^{\text{pred}} \right),$
    where the PhyscialLoss is:
    $\text{PhysicalLoss} (q^{\text{pred}}) = \lvert \lvert AIC \cdot \Gamma^{\text{pred}}(q^{\text{pred}}) - RHS \rvert \rvert.$
